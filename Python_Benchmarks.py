"""
This file contains different implmentations and benchmarks of
neighbour algorithms for use in AST326-Lab1

Rules for benchmarks:

Each benchmark shall...
#1 Use the same image (1288x964)
#2 Take in an image and threshold as parameters
#3 Be run on the same computer
#4 Not be required to insure proper arguments

Each benchmark produce an image where any dually-elevated event is set to 0.

A dually-elevated event is as follows:

A pixel with ADU value greater than the given threshold with
a neighbouring pixel which is greater than half the given threshold.

All benchmarks will be evaluated over 100 trials of the same image.
